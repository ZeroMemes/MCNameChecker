# MC Name Checker
A simple tool to perform mass look-ups of Minecraft username availability.

This project uses [AccountsClient](https://github.com/Mojang/AccountsClient) from [Mojang](https://github.com/Mojang).
I have modified it to have consumer response handling for profile lookups and to include the legacy (or unmigrated) status
of the account.
